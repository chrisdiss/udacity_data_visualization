## Data Visualization: Analyzing bike sharing service data

This project was part of the Udacity Nanodegree Data Analytics. In this project I analyzed the data of a bike sharing service and performed data visualization. My objective is to find insights in the data so the service provider can improve and ensure the quality of ist service.

## Motivation and Procedure

The motivation of this project is to build some interesting and insightful data visualizations and tell a story around this data. The data was given in a csv-file by udacity and first I did some data assessing and cleaning to build a good fundament for the following analysis. I then performed an extensive exploratory data analysis which contained a uni-, bi- and multivariate analysis for finding insights in the data. After this I realized a expenatory data analysis where I focused on the main findings in the data.

## Technology

For data analyzing I used python in a jupyter notebook environment.
